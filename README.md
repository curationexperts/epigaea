# Epigaea

[![ci](https://travis-ci.org/curationexperts/epigaea.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/curationexperts/epigaea)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/curationexperts/epigaea/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/curationexperts/epigaea?branch=master)

A [MIRA](https://github.com/TuftsUniversity/MIRA) replacement running on [Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax) 2.0.

## Development

Get started by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/curationexperts/epigaea.git
cd epigaea

cp .env.sample .env.development
bundle install
bundle exec rails db:setup
bundle exec sidekiq -d -l tmp/sidekiq.log
# open a separate session and run bundle exec rails hydra:server
```
Other services and settings required:
* MySQL
* Redis
* Path to [FITS](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/downloads) in the [Hyrax initializer](https://github.com/curationexperts/epigaea/blob/master/config/initializers/hyrax.rb)
* sidekiq as queue adapter in [application.rb](https://github.com/curationexperts/epigaea/blob/master/config/):        `config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq`

You can run CI with `rake` (or `rake ci`). Or start a server with `rake hydra:server`

## Re-create derivatives
If you need to re-create derivatives, use these rake tasks:
1. One at a time, by id: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake derivatives:recreate_by_id[2801pg32c]`
1. Re-create derivatives for all PDF objects: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake derivatives:recreate_all_pdfs`

## Monitoring
When running this application in production, you can point monitoring systems at `/okcomputer/all` to
verify that system integrations are working as expected. Checking for the absence of the word `FAILURE`
would work. If everything is working as expected, you should see:
```
  batch_sidekiq_queue_latency: PASSED Sidekiq queue 'batch' latency at reasonable level (0) (0s)
  database: PASSED Schema version: 20171009170516 (0s)
  default: PASSED Application is running (0s)
  default_sidekiq_queue_latency: PASSED Sidekiq queue 'default' latency at reasonable level (0) (0s)
  handle_sidekiq_queue_latency: PASSED Sidekiq queue 'handle' latency at reasonable level (0) (0s)
  smtp: PASSED SMTP connection working (1s)
```
You can also check individual systems by adding their name to the end of the okcomputer url, e.g., `/okcomputer/smtp`.
See [okcomputer on github](https://github.com/sportngin/okcomputer) for more configuration options.

## Email notifications
To change how email notifications are sent, edit the values in a `.env.production` file on your server. The capistrano deploy task is set up to expect that file to exist, and ActionMailer is configured to get its mail values from environment variables, which we have set using [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv). Please also change the email address of the batch_user to an address that can receive email. See `config/initializers/hyrax.rb` for batch_user configuration.
