# Epigaea

[![ci](https://travis-ci.org/curationexperts/epigaea.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/curationexperts/epigaea)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/curationexperts/epigaea/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/curationexperts/epigaea?branch=master)

A [MIRA](https://github.com/TuftsUniversity/MIRA) replacement running on [Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax) 2.0.

## Development

### dependencies
* MySQL
* Redis
* Path to [FITS](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/downloads) in the [Hyrax initializer](https://github.com/curationexperts/epigaea/blob/master/config/initializers/hyrax.rb)
* sidekiq as queue adapter in [application.rb](https://github.com/curationexperts/epigaea/blob/master/config/):        `config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq`


### initial setup
Get started by cloning the repository, installing the dependencies, and ensuring the test suite runs:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/curationexperts/epigaea.git
cd epigaea
bundle install
bundle exec sidekiq -d -l tmp/sidekiq.log

# start each of the next services in their own terminal session
bundle exec rake hydra:server 
bundle exec rake hydra:test_server

#back in your main terminal session
bundle exec rails db:setup
bundle exec rake spec
```

### running the development environment LDAP server
You need to start up the LDAP server using the `ladle` task and Solr, Fedora, and a webserver using the `hydra:server` task.
It's usually best to run each service in it's own terminal session.
```sh
# if you checked out new code, run the next two commands
# bundle install
# bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake ladle      #start an LDAP server in a new window
bundle exec hydra:server    #start the development server, fedora, and solr in a new window
# visit http://localhost:3000
```

The applicaiton is configured to use LDAP for authentication.  The development and test 
environments use the [ladle](https://github.com/NUBIC/ladle) gem to launch a self-contained LDAP server.
LDAP users are seeded from the file at `config/ldap_seed_users.ldif`, so you can login
using either `user@example.org` or `admin@example.org` with the password 'password'.

### making an admin user
First, you'll need to start your development server and login as one of the LDAP users.  
We'll assume you logged in as `admin@example.org`
```sh
bundle exec rails c
> u = User.find_by(email: 'admin@example.org')
> u.add_role('admin')
> exit
```
If you go back and refresh your browser where `admin@example.org` is logged in, you
should now have access to the administator dashboard.

### seeding deposit types
MIRA supports a number of configurable deposit types. A seed configuration is checked into the repository at 
`config/deposit_type_seed.csv`.  Load this seed file by running the following rake task:
```sh
bundle exec rake import:deposit_types[config/deposit_type_seed.csv]
# then enter `yes` to complete the import
```
If you wish to make changes to the seeds, use the "Manage Self Deposit Types" option from the administrator dashboard. 
Make any changes you want, export the configuration using the "Export Deposit Type Data" link at the bottom of the 
"Manage Deposit Types" view, and then check the updated deposit type configuration CSV file into the repository.


## Re-create derivatives
If you need to re-create derivatives, use these rake tasks:
1. One at a time, by id: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake derivatives:recreate_by_id[2801pg32c]`
1. Re-create derivatives for all PDF objects: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake derivatives:recreate_all_pdfs`

## Monitoring
When running this application in production, you can point monitoring systems at `/okcomputer/all` to
verify that system integrations are working as expected. Checking for the absence of the word `FAILURE`
would work. If everything is working as expected, you should see:
```
  batch_sidekiq_queue_latency: PASSED Sidekiq queue 'batch' latency at reasonable level (0) (0s)
  database: PASSED Schema version: 20171009170516 (0s)
  default: PASSED Application is running (0s)
  default_sidekiq_queue_latency: PASSED Sidekiq queue 'default' latency at reasonable level (0) (0s)
  handle_sidekiq_queue_latency: PASSED Sidekiq queue 'handle' latency at reasonable level (0) (0s)
  smtp: PASSED SMTP connection working (1s)
```
You can also check individual systems by adding their name to the end of the okcomputer url, e.g., `/okcomputer/smtp`.
See [okcomputer on github](https://github.com/sportngin/okcomputer) for more configuration options.

## Anayltics
Hyrax has some built-in integration with Google analytics. Instructions for configuration are
in the [Hyrax Management Guide](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Hyrax-Management-Guide#capturing-usage-and-download-counts). 
To track usage using google analytics:
1. Follow the abovementioned guide and set up a google analytics account. Take note of the analytics tracking id you
are assigned and the json key you are prompted to download.
2. Put the .json key in `/opt/epigaea/shared/config` and call it `epigaea_private_key.json`
3. Populate the `.env.production` file on the production server with the relevant values from `epigaea_private_key.json`:
  ```
    export GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-000000000-1
    export GOOGLE_OAUTH_APP_NAME=epigaea (make up any value here)
    export GOOGLE_OAUTH_APP_VERSION=2.0 (make up any value here)
    export GOOGLE_OAUTH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/opt/epigaea/config/epigaea_private_key.json
    export GOOGLE_OAUTH_PRIVATE_KEY_SECRET=[key from your .json file]
    export GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_EMAIL=epigaea@whatever.gserviceaccount.com (from your .json file)
  ```

**NOTE** The instructions above will allow you to track usage on the google analytics website.
Integration into the Hyrax admin dashboard has not yet been completed but is expected
eventually. See [Hyrax Analytics and Usage Statistics](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Hyrax-Management-Guide#analytics-and-usage-statistics) for more details.

## Notifications
### Sending notifications by email
All notifications use `Hyrax::MessengerService`, which in turn uses [Mailboxer](https://github.com/mailboxer/mailboxer). 
Mailboxer can be configured to send notifications by email. You can configure it to
use a different SMTP system by defining the appropriate values in a `.env.production` file. 
Required variables are:
```bash
  export ACTION_MAILER_SMTP_DELIVERY_METHOD=smtp
  export ACTION_MAILER_HOST=localhost
  export ACTION_MAILER_SMTP_ADDRESS=**YOUR DATA HERE**
  export ACTION_MAILER_PORT=**YOUR DATA HERE**
  export ACTION_MAILER_USER_NAME=**YOUR DATA HERE**
  export ACTION_MAILER_PASSWORD=**YOUR DATA HERE**
```

### Creating or editing notifications
Notifications are defined in `app/services/hyrax/workflow`. There are three kinds of notifications.
1. **MiraWorkflowNotification** -- These are subclasses of the Hyrax workflow notifications. They are triggered by Sipity workflow events, as defined in `config/workflows/mira_publication_workflow.json`. These include comment notifications, and publishing and unpublishing of single works.

2. **MiraNotification** -- These are single-item notifications which are not triggered by a SipityWorkflow event. These are primarily used for notification of single-item deposits, either via the `/contribute` form or the `Create New Work` form on the admin dashboard.

3. **MiraBatchNotification** -- These are batch notifications. They inherit some behavior from the `MiraNotification` class, but operate at a batch level instead of at an individual level. Examples include batch xml import, batch metadata update, batch publish, batch unpublish, and batch template application.

## Contribute Collections
The `/contribute` forms deposit works into specific collections. In order to ensure that the expected collections exist, they are 
created at application deploy time and (if necessary) at deposit time via the `Tufts::ContributeCollections` class. To change the names or
identifiers of these Collection objects, edit the `app/lib/tufts/contribute_collections.rb` file. To create the collections explicitly, run `rake tufts:create_contribute_collections`.
